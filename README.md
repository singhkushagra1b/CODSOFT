## Number Guessing Game

A console-based game where the player has to guess a randomly generated number within a given range. The game provides feedback after each attempt and limits the number of tries.

### How to Play

1. Compile and run the program.
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to start guessing the number.

### Compilation

Use a C++ compiler (e.g., g++) to compile the program:


## Simple Calculator

A simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations based on user input.

### How to Use

1. Compile and run the program.
2. Input two numbers and choose an operation (+, -, *, /).

### Compilation

Compile using a C++ compiler:


## Tic-Tac-Toe Game

An implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game for two players. Players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid until one player has three marks in a row, column, or diagonal.

### How to Play

1. Compile and run the program.
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to make moves.

### Compilation

Compile with a C++ compiler:


## To-Do List Manager

A command-line application that allows users to manage a list of tasks. Users can add, view, mark as completed, and remove tasks.

### How to Use

1. Compile and run the program.
2. Choose an option from the menu to perform actions like adding tasks, viewing tasks, etc.

### Compilation

Compile using a C++ compiler:
